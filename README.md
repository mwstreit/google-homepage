This is the first real project I am completing for The Odin Project.

By the end of this project, I will have created a replica of the Google homepage.  Yikes.

This is as close to the Google homepage for 02/07/2017 as I could get.  It's not perfect, but pretty close.

Notable inaccuracies: 

The 'Apps' link at the top does not match the grid pattern in the original, nor does it open a drop down.

The seachbar is not quite the right size and lacks the microphone icon and functionality

The 'I'm feeling lucky' search button does not change

The page has zero functionality and most of the links don't go to the right page

Still, not bad.  If I didn't know it was a fake I'd be convinced by looking at it.

Google's CSS is really complex.  At least to me at this point.
